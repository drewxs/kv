# KV

Distributed key-value store.

Organizes key-value pairs into buckets and distributes those buckets across multiple nodes,
including a simple client allowing connection to any of those nodes and send requests.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `kv` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:kv, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/kv>.
